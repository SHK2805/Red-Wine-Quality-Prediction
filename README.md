### ML Pipeline
* The ML pipeline is a sequence of steps that are executed in order to build, train, evaluate, and deploy a machine learning model.
* Below are the steps in the ML pipeline:
1. Data Collection
2. Data Ingestion
3. Data Transformation
4. Model Training
5. Model Evaluation
6. Model Deployment
7. Model Monitoring
8. Model Retraining

### Workflow
* We update the below files in that order to achieve the ML pipeline:
1. config.yaml
2. schema.yaml
3. params.yaml
4. Update the entity
5. Update the configuration manager in src config
6. Update the components in src components
7. Update the pipeline in src pipeline
8. Update the main.py
